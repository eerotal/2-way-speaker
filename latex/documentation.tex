\section{Introduction}

\noindent This PDF contains documentation for my self designed vented two way
speakers. All the design files can be found from the GIT repository at
\url{https://github.com/eerotal/2-way-speaker}.\\

\noindent The speaker specifications are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Cabinet volume (V): 20 l
\item Cabinet tuning frequenxy (Fb): 42.49 Hz
\item Woofer: Visaton W-170 S 8Ohm
\item Tweeter: Visaton SC-10 N
\end{itemize}

\noindent The speaker cabinet was designed to have a frequency response that's
as flat as possible over the entire bandwidth of the speaker. The cabinet
features a theoretically optimal reflex port designed based on various research
papers on the subject. The cabinet is constructed from concrete and wood to
increase its mass and to improve speaker performance.\\

\noindent The speaker uses a crossover circuit made using third order
Butterworth filters. Speaker impedance and sensitivity matching was also taken
into account while desiging the filter. All design and documentation files were
created using open file formats, tools and technologies.

\noindent You can run the bash script \texttt makedocs.sh to generate this
PDF file.
